## Project Scope:
(One sentence) An informative app that lists nearby coffee shops/cafes/roasters and integrates social features for sharing.
(Longer) An informative app that contains a database of many coffee shops/cafes/roasters in Singapore, so that users can easily look up for one they wish to visit. The app also has a social feature that allows coffee shop owners and customers to share anything about coffee.

## 1.1 Target audience
The target audience of this project is coffee shop owners in Singapore, as well as any member of public interested in Singaporeâ€™s local coffee scene.

## 1.2 Why this app?
For the majority, coffee is more likened to a quick way to start the day rather than something to be slowly enjoyed. They have underappreciated the beauty of coffee.
At the same time, there is a growing movement of specialty coffee shops and roasters in Singapore. However it is difficult for them to garner popularity amongst the myriad of restaurants in Singapore.
Furthermore, as beginners who just scratched the surface of coffee making, when we try to brew a cup of coffee ourselves, we found it quite troublesome to find this information. There were all kinds of devices and methods. We realised there was a need for a centralized system to make it easier to access this knowledge.

## 1.3 How our app solves the problem
By integrating features like sharing of coffee culture and brewing techniques into our app, we aim to accelerate the spread of awareness and appreciation for coffee in the local scene.
We also hope to help coffee lovers connect with each other in sharing techniques, experiences and recipes. The application can offer a clean and standardised user interface to make content sharing easier. There is no more hassle of going on to different internet forums to search for answers.

## 2.1 Current features
Login page where users can sign up with their emails. Data will be stored in a Firebase cloud. Have not configured Google or Apple sign in.
Nearby page fetches shop info from the Firestore (NoSQL) and populates a list for a user to view. Upon tapping on the shop listing, the user is taken to the Google Maps search result for that particular shop.

## 2.2 Future features
We aim to complete the forum for coffee lovers to do content sharing and an online shop that lists nearby roasters and their stock of beans.
We also aim to improve the Nearby page, adding more information about the coffee shops as well as enabling the ability for users to see their actual nearby shops.

## Timeline:
28/05 - 03/06: Complete Google and Apple authentication sign in. Populate the Nearby page.
04/06 - 10/06: Implement forum for content sharing.
11/06 - 17/06: Implement an online shop.
18/06 - 24/06: Testing and improvements.
